# FLEET-MIND
### The Basics:
This is a strategy game written in Java using the AWT library. It was inspired by something described in the novel Ender's Game.

The objective is to design a set of basic intructions for your fleet, enabling them to attack and destroy the enemy ships.
It features one player and two player gamemodes. Information on how to play can be found in game.

Here's a quick look at what a battle looks like:

### Gameplay:
The ships pictured above are acting so intelligently because of the way they were programmed. Programming your fleet is at the core of this game. Availible to you are a set of basic sensory inputs from all the ships. It's up to you to decide how your ships will react to certain events.

This powerful programming is made possible by the ultra-intuitive user-interface pictured below:
