Fleet Mind is a strategy game. You are in charge of a 
small fleet of 5 ships and your goal is to crush the 
enemy fleet that opposes you. 
You have one tool: the STRATEGY BUILDER.

The STRATEGY BUILDER is how you control your fleet. 
With it, you can design clever instructions for all 
your ships to follow in battle.

It is made up of boxes like this:





Each of these boxes acts as an if-then statement. 
If all the conditions on the left 
are true, then the action on the right will be executed.
Edit a bubble to edit the condition or action. 
Edit the tiny ovals below the condition bubbles 
to make a condition negative.





This box reads "If an ally is not in sight and an 
enemy is in sight, then fire!"

In the STRATEGY BUILDER, you are also able to select 
the starting formation of your fleet as well as save 
and load your favourite strategies.

When your are ready to go, the big "Test" 
button will start a battle!

This may seem confusing right now but once you 
get the hang of it, the possibilities are endless. 
Pretty soon, you'll be leading a super-intelligent
fleet of terror! 
The best way to learn is doing, so jump over to 
one of the gamemodes and start strategizing!

Have fun :)
